    "\n",
    "#### _Basic Examples_\n",
    "\n",
    "If-Then statements perform an operation if a statement is True.   \"If [x is true], then do [y]\".   The if-then statements are ended by a ```:```.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The program ``ex29.py`` is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def execute(people=20,cats=30,dogs=15):\n",
    " if people < cats:\n",
    "    print(\"Too many cats! The world is doomed!\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if people > cats:\n",
    "    print(\"Not many cats! The world is saved!\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if people < dogs:\n",
    "    print(\"The world is drooled on!\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if people > dogs:\n",
    "    print(\"The world is dry!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " dogs += 5\n",
    "\n",
    " if people >= dogs:\n",
    "    print(\"People are greater than or equal to dogs.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if people <= dogs:\n",
    "    print(\"People are less than or equal to dogs.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " if people == dogs:\n",
    "    print(\"People are dogs.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed, note one thing about the values for variables \"people\", \"cats\", and \"dogs\" in the function call.  They seem to be assigned specific values.   And indeed the values listed are exactly what are used if you do _not_ override them at the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what happens in this program?  Depending on the value of \"people\", \"dogs\", and \"cats\" different things are printed.   Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from ex29 import execute\n",
    "\n",
    "execute()\n",
    "```\n",

    "The world is dry!\n",
    "People are greater than or equal to dogs.\n",
    "People are less than or equal to dogs.\n",
    "People are dogs.\n",

    "#### _If/El-If/Else  Statement Structures_\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to add another wrinkle: If/El-If/Else structures.  Before, with an if-then statement, we execute a block of code if a given condition is met.   The If/El-If/Else is like that but allows for a branching of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "See _ex30.py_ below\n",

    "    print(\"We should take the cars.\")\n",
    " elif cars < people:\n",
    "    print(\"We should not take the cars.\")\n",
    " else:\n",
    "    print(\"We can't decide.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if trucks > cars:\n",
    "    print(\"That's too many trucks.\")\n",
    " elif trucks < cars:\n",
    "    print(\"Maybe we could take the trucks.\")\n",
    " else:\n",
    "    print(\"We still can't decide.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " if people > trucks:\n",
    "    print(\"Alright, let's just take the trucks.\")\n",
    " else:\n",
